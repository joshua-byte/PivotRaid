PivotRaid is a lightweight, red-team-oriented automation tool designed to analyze exposed **FTP** and **SMB** services. It automates the tedious process of manual service enumeration to identify file exposure, weak configurations, and cross-service lateral movement pathways.

By correlating data from both protocols, PivotRaid identifies how an attacker can leverage weak configurations or shared file contents on one service to pivot and compromise another.

## Key Features

* **FTP Security Auditing:** Automatically tests for anonymous login, enumerates directories, and grabs service banners to flag outdated, vulnerable versions.
* **SMB Share Analysis:** Validates null session access, enumerates active shares, and tests read/write permissions across accessible directories.
* **Sensitive File Exposure Detection:** Scans directories using optimized regex patterns to flag high-value targets (e.g., `.git`, `.env`, backups, SSH keys, configuration files, and database credentials).
* **Cross-Service Correlation Engine:** Evaluates findings from both services to map realistic local and lateral attack paths (e.g., finding credentials on an open SMB share and testing them against FTP).
* **Risk Scoring & Analytics:** Provides a confidence-based severity score for discovered attack paths to help defenders prioritize remediation.
* **Professional Reporting:** Generates an executive-ready, interactive **HTML report** detailing findings, evidence, mapped attack paths, and remediation steps.
